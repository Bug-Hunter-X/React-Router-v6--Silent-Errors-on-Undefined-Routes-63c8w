This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6: navigating to undefined routes. The `undefinedRouteBug.js` file showcases the problem, where clicking a link leads to an unexpected outcome (blank screen) because the route isn't defined.  `undefinedRouteSolution.js` provides a solution using the `<Route path='*' />` component as a catch-all to handle undefined routes gracefully.
