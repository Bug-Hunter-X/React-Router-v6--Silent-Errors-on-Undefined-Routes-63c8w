In React Router Dom v6,  a common issue arises when navigating to a route that doesn't exist or has not been defined within your routes configuration. This often results in unexpected behavior or silent errors, making it difficult to debug.  For example, if you have a link to `/profile` but haven't defined a `<Route path='/profile' ... />`, React Router might not display any error message, but the application might render an empty page or unexpected content.
